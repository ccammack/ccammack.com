[FreeBSD 12](https://www.freebsd.org/) enables VNET support by default, which gives each jail its own network stack and makes it easy to jail individual applications using [iocage](https://iocage.io/).

<!--more-->

To get started, make sure FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE is installed and that the system uses ZFS, which is required by iocage:

{{< highlight txt >}}
$ uname -a
FreeBSD freebsd 12.0-RELEASE-p7 FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE-p7 GENERIC  amd64

$ zpool list
NAME    SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
zroot   928G  2.17G   926G        -         -     0%     0%  1.00x  ONLINE  -

My server gets its IP address from the router using DHCP, so the initial server settings look like this:

{{< highlight txt >}}
$ cat /etc/rc.conf
hostname="freebsd"
ifconfig_bge0="DHCP"
sshd_enable="YES"
# Set dumpdev to "AUTO" to enable crash dumps, "NO" to disable
dumpdev="AUTO"
zfs_enable="YES"

$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf
# $FreeBSD: releng/12.0/sbin/sysctl/sysctl.conf 337624 2018-08-11 13:28:03Z brd
$
#
#  This file is read when going to multi-user and its contents piped thru
#  ``sysctl'' to adjust kernel values.  ``man 5 sysctl.conf'' for details.
#

# Uncomment this to prevent users from seeing information about processes that
# are being run under another UID.
#security.bsd.see_other_uids=0

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by resolvconf
search hsd1.ca.comcast.net
nameserver 192.168.0.1
{{< /highlight >}}

> To try this in a VM rather than on real hardware, bridge the network adapter and enable promiscuous mode.

Update the system and install iocage.

Examine **rc.conf** or run **ifconfig** to get the name of the network interface, which is **bge0** in this case.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# cat /etc/rc.conf
hostname="freebsd"
ifconfig_bge0="DHCP"
sshd_enable="YES"
# Set dumpdev to "AUTO" to enable crash dumps, "NO" to disable
dumpdev="AUTO"
zfs_enable="YES"

# ifconfig
bge0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> metric 0 mtu 1500
        options=c0099<RXCSUM,VLAN_MTU,VLAN_HWTAGGING,VLAN_HWCSUM,VLAN_HWTSO,LINKSTATE>

        status: active
        nd6 options=29<PERFORMNUD,IFDISABLED,AUTO_LINKLOCAL>

Edit **rc.conf** and add three lines to the bottom to *enable iocage at startup*, create a *network bridge*, and *attach the bridge* to the host's network interface.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# cat /etc/rc.conf
hostname="freebsd"
ifconfig_bge0="DHCP"
sshd_enable="YES"
# Set dumpdev to "AUTO" to enable crash dumps, "NO" to disable
dumpdev="AUTO"
zfs_enable="YES"

iocage_enable="YES"
cloned_interfaces="bridge0"
ifconfig_bridge0="addm bge0 up"
{{< /highlight >}}


Edit **sysctl.conf** and add four lines to the bottom to *enable IP forwarding* and *disable packet filtering* on the bridge.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# cat /etc/sysctl.conf
# $FreeBSD: releng/12.0/sbin/sysctl/sysctl.conf 337624 2018-08-11 13:28:03Z brd $
#
#  This file is read when going to multi-user and its contents piped thru
#  ``sysctl'' to adjust kernel values.  ``man 5 sysctl.conf'' for details.
#

# Uncomment this to prevent users from seeing information about processes that
# are being run under another UID.
#security.bsd.see_other_uids=0

net.inet.ip.forwarding=1       # Enable IP forwarding between interfaces
net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0  # Only pass IP packets when pfil is enabled
net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0  # Packet filter on the bridge interface
net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0  # Packet filter on the member interface

**Activate** the appropriate zpool to tell iocage where to put files and **fetch** the lastest system release.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# zpool list
NAME    SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  CKPOINT  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
zroot   928G  2.17G   926G        -         -     0%     0%  1.00x  ONLINE  -

# iocage activate zroot
ZFS pool 'zroot' successfully activated.

# iocage fetch -r latest

To create a jail that uses DHCP to request an IP address from the router, call **iocage create** and specify the **bpf** and **dhcp** parameters.
In this example, the router assigned IP address 192.168.0.**116** to jail **j0** on startup.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# iocage create -n "j0" -r latest vnet="on" allow_raw_sockets="1" boot="on" bpf="yes" dhcp="on"
j0 successfully created!
* Starting j0
  + Started OK
  + Using devfs_ruleset: 5
  + Configuring VNET OK
  + Starting services OK
  + Executing poststart OK
  + DHCP Address: 192.168.0.116/24
{{< /highlight >}}

Alternatively, to create a jail with a static IP address, call **iocage create** and specify the **defaultrouter** and **ip4_addr** parameters.
In this example, I have manually assigned IP address 192.168.0.**254** to jail **j1**.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# iocage create -n "j1" -r latest vnet="on" allow_raw_sockets="1" boot="on" defaultrouter="192.168.0.1" ip4_addr="192.168.0.254/24"
j1 successfully created!
* Starting j1
  + Started OK
  + Using devfs_ruleset: 6
  + Configuring VNET OK
  + Starting services OK
  + Executing poststart OK
{{< /highlight >}}

Each time a jail starts, it automatically copies */etc/resolv.conf* from the host system to the jail.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by resolvconf
search hsd1.ca.comcast.net
nameserver 192.168.0.1

# iocage exec j0 cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by resolvconf
search hsd1.ca.comcast.net
nameserver 192.168.0.1
{{< /highlight >}}

If the information in *resolv.conf* is not correct for some network setups, use the jail's **resolver** property to override it.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# iocage set resolver="search hsd1.ca.comcast.net;nameserver 192.168.0.1" j0
{{< /highlight >}}

On systems with complicated network setups, use the jail's **interfaces** property to assign the correct **vnet** and **bridge** to the jail.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# iocage set interfaces="vnet0:bridge0" j0
{{< /highlight >}}

From another machine on the network, **ping** the jails to make sure they are working

Use **iocage list** to see the status of the jails.

In recent versions of FreeBSD, shell scripts placed inside the folder */usr/local/etc/rc.d* will automatically run at system startup,
and this same technique can also be used to run programs inside a jail when the jail starts.

In addition, the file system for each jail is stored under */zroot/iocage/jails/* on the host, making it possible for the host system to access the jailed file systems directly if needed.

To create a tiny web server inside the jail for testing, *make sure the rc.d folder exists* in the jail, then *add an executable startup script* to that folder and *reboot* the system.

{{< highlight txt >}}
# iocage exec j1 mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/rc.d
# echo 'while true ; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n`hostname`: `date`" | nc -l 8080 -N ; done' > /zroot/iocage/jails/j1/root/usr/local/etc/rc.d/one-line-web-server.sh
# iocage exec j1 cat /usr/local/etc/rc.d/one-line-web-server.sh
while true ; do echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n`hostname`: `date`" | nc -l 8080 -N ; done
# iocage exec j1 chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/one-line-web-server.sh
# reboot

> This little one-line web server works well enough for a quick test, but because it runs as a foreground process,
it interferes with the normal start and stop functions of the jail system and may prevent other jails from starting at all.

> It can be run in the background by appending "&" to the end of the line as usual, but when I tested that, Firefox was the only browser that worked reliably.
The other browsers I tried returned ERR_CONNECTION_ABORTED errors several times while refreshing the page.

After the system reboots, open http://192.168.0.254:8080/ in a web browser and make sure the web server reports the jail's name and current date.
